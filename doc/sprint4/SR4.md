# Unfinished Stories / Tasks

Nothing!

# Demo Feedback

Was suggested we think about a "challenge" or "room code" system for head to head with a daily limit vs having random matchmaking.
There were also a few labels that were dark on a dark background which made them hard to read.

# Practices We Should / Shouldn't Continue and New Practices

Our git flow and code review practices prove to be very effective and should be continued.
Introducing a strict rebasing rule (over pulling in changes from master) prevented obscure git issues that arise from rebasing with merge commits.

There were no practices that were troublesome this sprint!

# Best / Worst Experience in Sprint 4

There weren't any bad experiences this sprint.

Team morale was high because we were nearing feature complete.
We also reaped the benefits of clean code written early on as we could refactor and reuse a lot of code this sprint.
